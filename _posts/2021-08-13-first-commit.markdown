Old habits die hard. I first started my journey into software development at the end of 2018. At that time using git seemed impossibly difficult.

I joined a coding bootcamp, [Next Academy](https://www.nextacademy.com), everyday was intense, having previously worked as a cook helped.

So to get by, I copied from tutorials, guides and StackOverflow posts and dived deep enough just to get things done. `git commit -m 'first commit'` became a reflex.

Seemed to be an appropriate title for my first blog post. Welcome to my blog, where I'll be posting about topics I find interesting, mostly programming, climbing and cooking.
